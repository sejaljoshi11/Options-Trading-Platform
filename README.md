# Options Trading Platform

A decentralized options trading platform built on blockchain technology using Solidity and Hardhat framework.

## Project Description

The Options Trading Platform is a sophisticated decentralized finance (DeFi) application that enables users to create, trade, and exercise options contracts on the blockchain. This platform eliminates traditional intermediaries while providing transparent, secure, and automated options trading with real-time settlement.

The system supports both CALL and PUT options with customizable strike prices, premiums, and expiry dates. It features automated collateral management, real-time pricing integration, and trustless execution of option contracts. All transactions are recorded immutably on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and eliminating counterparty risk.
